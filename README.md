 WHO (World Health Organization) estimates that out of 5 deaths, 4 of them are realted to the cardiovascular disease(CVD), so the goal of this project is to use Logistic Regression to determine the propoertion of patients who are at a high risk of CVD. 

 This project focuses on preprocessing, class imbalance handling, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating model performance using real-world health data.
